You are an expert full stack engineer. Build a small web-based Gemini-based app that generates synthetic student submissions for a given assignment. 

Tech stack:
- Frontend: React (single page app)
- Backend: Python Flask API
- Data: downloadable zip file and save in database   

High level behavior:
- User can input:
  - Assignment title
  - Assignment description (long text)
  - Optional rubric (structured or unstructured text)
  - Number of synthetic students to generate
  - Options for:
    - Grade distribution (for example: mostly average, normal distribution, or custom percentages for A/B/C/D/F)
    - Writing level (for example: high school, early undergrad, advanced undergrad)
    - Variation parameters (for example: more or less diversity in style, verbosity, structure)

- App output:
  - A table of synthetic student submissions where each row includes at least:
    - Synthetic student id
    - Synthetic student name
    - Simulated grade or score
    - Submission text
    - Short feedback comment
    - Optional rubric-based breakdown (for example: criteria scores, comments per criterion) if rubric is provided 
  - Ability to:
    - Filter and search submissions
    - Sort by grade, name, length, etc
    - Export data as CSV and JSON or as PDF files in azipped folder

Frontend requirements:
- Clean, minimal UI with:
  - A form section on the left/top to configure:
    - Assignment title and description
    - Optional rubric text area
    - Number of students
    - Grade distribution and writing level
  - A button "Generate synthetic submissions"
  - A main results section that:
    - Shows a loading indicator while backend is generating
    - Displays submissions in a paginated table
    - Allows clicking a row to see full submission text and detailed rubric breakdown in a side panel or modal
  - Buttons to "Export CSV" and "Export JSON"or "Download as zip" 

Backend requirements:
- Flask app exposing endpoints:
  - POST /api/generate_submissions
    - Request body: assignment description, optional rubric, generation parameters
    - Response: list of synthetic submissions as described above
  - GET /api/health for basic health check
- Implement a synthetic generation module that:
   
    - Uses deterministic or pseudo random logic to:
      - Vary writing quality according to target grade
      - Introduce typical student variation:
        - Different levels of structure and coherence
        - Small grammar mistakes for lower grades
        - Varying length and detail
      - If rubric is provided, generates per criterion scores and short comments that are roughly consistent with the overall grade
  - Organize the generation code so it can later be swapped out with an LLM call (for example: isolated function generate_submissions(inputs) that returns a structured Python list of dicts)

Data model (backend):
- Define a Submission object (or simple dict schema) with fields:
  - id: string
  - student_name: string
  - grade: string or numeric
  - total_score: numeric
  - submission_text: string
  - rubric_scores: list or dict of {criterion_name, score, comment} when rubric exists
- Make sure the endpoint returns clean JSON conforming to this schema

Implementation details:
- Provide complete runnable code for:
  - Frontend React app (including package.json, main component, and any necessary hooks or utils)
  - Backend Flask app (including requirements.txt and clear instructions on how to run)
- Include clear instructions at the end:
  - How to install dependencies
  - How to start the backend server
  - How to start the frontend dev server
  - How to configure the frontend to point to the backend (for example: base URL config)

Code quality:
- Use clear function and variable names
- Add concise comments explaining nontrivial logic, especially in the synthetic text generation part
- Validate user input where reasonable (for example: max number of students, non empty assignment description)

Now provide the full implementation:
1) Backend Flask code
2) Frontend React code
3) Setup and run instructions
